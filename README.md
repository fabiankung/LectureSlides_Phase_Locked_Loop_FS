# Slides on Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) and Frequency Synthesizer
A series of lecture slides introducing the operating principles of phase-locked loop and it's application to radio-frequency (RF) frequency synthesizer application.
In this repository I also shared two experimental circuits:
1. An RF frequency synthesizer based on popular PLL chips such as ADF4112, ADF4156 etc. The PLL chip is controlled by Arduino, whose codes you can easily customize to other micro-controllers and processors.
2. A PLL construction using the classic 74HC4046 CMOS chip, this is useful for beginners to learn to build their own high-frequency PLL and to observe it behaviors with oscilloscope and logic analyzer.
